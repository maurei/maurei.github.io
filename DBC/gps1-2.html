        What are the advantages?
        </div>
        <div class="content">
        Working with more people on the same thing gives your the opportunity to understand other people's view solutions to exercises.
        It's important to DBC because it will allow you to experience the collaborative environment the way it will be in a real world work environment.

        Driving and Navigating
        </div>
        <div class="content">
        You can't work on the same line of code at the same time, someone has got to be "driving", while the other does the "navigating"
        The driver will write the actually code and think about f.e. the syntax, while the navigator is having an overview of the problem and the code is going into the right direction.
