		<div>One of the hard things of my youth</div>

		<p>It doesn't occur very often that I have a serious conflict. It is hard to frustrate me, and I consider myself as a very reasonable person when it comes to making a move during an argument.
		</p>
		<p>
		Thinking of recent conflicts, I remember feeling serious anger towards one person in my group of friends. When it comes to arranging stuff for our group, for example an holiday, you always have people who take initiative and people who don't. I'm with the first group, the person I was angry with belongs to the second category. What happened was that he didn't perform his small tasks for organizing a holiday, and I ended up sorting it out for him.
		</p>
		<p>
		I resolved it like always: like I said, I did his work for him. If I wouldn't have done that, there was a risc our holiday wouldn't be able to take place. That wasn't worth it for me. The problem with this approach is that he'll never learn to do it by himself, and he'll never learn he is laziness is seriously obstructive until someone decides not to cover up for him
		</p>
		<p>
		A better approach would've been to let him find out by himself that he is messing things up. Only that way, he will take actions to prevent it from happening again, which will in turn result in no more frustrations on my side.
