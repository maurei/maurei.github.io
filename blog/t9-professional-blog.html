			<p>
			Writing blogs have been a new experience to me. It was nice to build on my personal space on the web, although I found it hard sometimes to think of good content to write.
			The most satisfactory thing for me was the technical part. I really had struggles with HTML and CSS, and I've had two 'major' maintenance projects during the past few weeks.
			</p>
			<p>
			Firstly, I threw away almost my complete site which I had created initially. When making the first version I was terrible at positioning. After having done more challenges I felt more comfortable with it and I decided to put it to practise. The result is my page as it is now, for the largest part. 
			</p>
			<p>
			The second thing I worked on is the 3x3 raster of social media icons. Even though I'm not perfectly happy about the final result, it was a good exercise.
