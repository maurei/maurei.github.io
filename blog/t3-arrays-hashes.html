		<div class="blogtitle">Arrays and Hashes</div>
		<div>Two concepts central to Ruby</div>
		<div class="blogdate">November 11th, 2014</div>
		<div class="blogdescription"><p>One of the most important thing in programming is handling data in a simple way. Without, programming will become very much a skill of repeative actions. Gladly, we have the posibility to use arrays and hashes. To understand hashes it's best to understand arrays first, so that's where I will start. Now, what exactly is an array? Lets go one step back: how do we store data anyway?</p>
		<p>When we want to hold on to some data, we can store it in a variable, like this
		<p class="code"> my_variable = "cow"</p>
		Here, we assigned <i>cow</i> to my_variable. Because of the quotations, <i>cow</i> is defined as a string, which is just a type of data. There are more types, for example integers and floats. Now, what if we want to assign more animals to my_variable than just <i>cow</i>? That's where arrays come in!
		<p class="code"> my_array = ["cow", "elephant", "dog"] </p>
		As you can see, an array is just a variable to which a collection of data is assigned. The principle of an array has been around for ages; physicist use a comparable object called <i>vectors</i> to describe multiple properties at once. Arrays - just like vectors - are n-dimensional, which is to say that you can put in as many elements as you want. Instead of defining "cow" as the first element, you even can put in another array! However, let's not over-complicate it and keep it to strings for now.</p>
		<p>Having an array defined as a collection of animals, we can do all kinds of things with it. For example, we can view the n-th element, like this:
		<p class="code">
		puts my_array[0]<br>
		=> cow
		</p>
		Here, I viewed the first element making use of the arrays index. The index starts from zero until <i>n-1</i> where n equals the amount of elements. What if we wanted to add more information, for example which animal we like best? You could solve this by inserting them by rank into your array, but that seems like an dirty work-around instead of a clean solution. Getting back at arrays within arrays, we could assign a rank to each animal like this:
		<p class="code">my_array = [ ["cow", 1], ["elephant", 3], ["dog",2] ]</p>
		Note how I put an array within the original array. Now, my_array is defined as a <i>collection of collections</i> of data! If you're wondering why I didn't put quotiations around the new parts: that's because not everything is a string anymore. In fact, integers and the (sub-)arrays don't need quotations, that would transform them into strings.</p>
		<p>It still isn't perfect, because we can't just look-up the rank of elephant, unless we exactly know its position within the array. Programmers came up with a solution for that: hashes. Hashes are very much similar to arrays, but the biggest difference is that the elements always come in pairs: a key and it's corresponding value. Demonstrating it will make it more obvious:
		<p class="code">
		my_hash = { "cow" => 1, "elephant" => 3, "dog" => 2}
		</p>
		Apart from some deviation in the syntax, it looks very similar to my previous array. Now, the convenient thing of using hashes is that the elements aren't defined by some index value depending on the position within the hash. Calling on the <i>key</i>, for example "cow", we can view the corresponding <i>value</i>, which in this case would be 1.
		<p class="code">
		puts my_hash["cow"]<br>
		=> 1
		</p>
		Arrays and hashes are very much alike, it contains the same information. But now, we can look up the rank of each animal without knowing its position in the hash! I can just call onto the animal I would like to know the rank of. So, hashes  more user-friendly. Well, there is much more to that, but nothing I want to start about in this introductionary blog.</p>
