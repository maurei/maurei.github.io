		<div>An explanation of a Ruby Enumerable method</div>
		<div class="blogdate">November 19th, 2014</div>
		<div class="blogdescription">
		<p>What makes Ruby so powerful is that it comes with a huge variety of built-in methods. Before starting on a method of a type you haven't built before, it's best to first check-out Ruby's documentation to check whether there is something that does 90% of the job for you. For one of my exercises, I ended up re-building an already existing Ruby method that I didn't know of: group_by. I'm not going to show you how I should have implemented this method in one of my exercises, I'm just going to demostrate how group_by functions. First, I will try to outline what it does in simple words. Then, I will demonstrate the method by using it on an array. Luckily, we talked all about hashes in my previous blog post. This stuff will come back right at us!</p>
		<p>To put it simple, group_by breaks a collection (a hash or an array) into groups depending on some given criteria. It needs a <i>block</i> of code that contains the criteria. This block will also determine what groups there will be. The output will be a hash containing the groups as its keys, and elements of the initial collection as the keys' values.</p>
		<p>Let's put it to an example. Remember the array of animals from my <a href="t3-arrays-hashes.html">previous</a> blog post? Let's put a few more in there.
		<p class="code">my_array = ["cow", "elephant", "dog", "cat", "deer"]</p>
		Now, imagine we want to group our collection alphabetically. I'm just going to show the code and I will explain it afterwards. Look closely...
		<p class="code">my_array.group_by {|animal| animal[0]}<br>
		=> {"c"=>["cow", "cat"], "e"=>["elephant"], "d"=>["dog", "deer"]}</p>
		</p>
		<p>Now, what happened here? Firstly, we called our method group_by on the array by writing:
		<p class="code">my_array.group_by</p>
		Then, we need to write the block of code that tells the method what to do:
		<p class="code">{ |animal|  animal[0]  }</p>
		This one is a little bit tricky. You should realize that our method <i>iterates</i> over my_array. That is to say: first it regards the first element, runs the block of code, does something depending on the output of that code, and then it moves on to the second element. What happens in this particular case is as follows: it grabs the first element from my_array ("cow"), it temporarily assigns it to <i>animal</i> (if it would've said |creature| instead of |animal|, that would've been the variable cow was assigned to).</p>

		Then it peforms the subsequent code: animal[0]. This selects the first letter of the variable animal, which equals "c" during the first iteration. When the iteration is completed, the method knows the first character of each element of my_array. It found that there are only three unique characters, and at that point group_by knows enough to do the rest. It gives as output:
			<p class="code">=> {"c"=>["cow", "cat"], "e"=>["elephant"], "d"=>["dog", "deer"]}</p>
		As you can see, the three groups are "c", "e" and "d", which was determined by animal[0]. Then, it put every element as value of the key it belongs to. Neat, isn't it?
