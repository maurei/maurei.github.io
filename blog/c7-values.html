		<div>How certain values are important to me</div>

			<p>
			Looking at the values I picked, they seem to be groupable in two categories. Firstly, many values are performance-based, meaning they depend on how I thrive in working/study environments. Some of these values are: Accomplishment, Recognition, Achievement, Reputation, Ambition or Intellectual status. To what extent I pursuit these values can be expressed in terms of how I perform: grades in University, bonuses at work, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
			On the other hand, there are values that belong to the group of joy. Think of Pleasure, Confidence, Inner Harmony, Free Time, Adventure. I think of these values as the opposite of values from the first category: pursuing f.e. Intellectual status and Recognition will go at cost of Free Time and Pleasure. This is not to say that achieving great things won't give me pleasure; I interpret pleasure as a way of relaxation. 
			</p>
			<p>
			This means I have to find a balance between joy and performance, which I think is normal to everyone. As a student, you might have lived a phase in your life in which you only pursued Free Time and Pleasure (that is to say: going out, being young), sometimes accompanied by stressful moments in which a lack of Achievement and Intellectual status comes to your mind. And later on in your life, it might be exactly the other way around.
			</p>
			<p>
			Concerning stereotype threats, I find it hard to think of how these values can help me. As far as I know, that is because I have never felt a stereotype threat. 
			Instead of a stereotype threat, having failed in a challenging situation usually results in feeling down, meaning the emotion is a result of the performance itself and not caused by a predecent phenomenon like a stereotype threat.
			</p>
			<p>
			For me, recognition (something else that is good about me) works well when occur in such a situation. It re-emphasizes reality, removing attention from a failure.
