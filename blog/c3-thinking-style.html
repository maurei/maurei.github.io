		<div class="blogtitle">How Do I Think?</div>
		<div>A self-reflection concerning my thinking-style</div>
		<div class="blogdate">November 13th, 2014</div>
		<div class="blogdescription">
			<p>My thinking-style is Abstract Sequential. There, I said it. I wasn't sure what it meant, but when I was prompted to do research, I was very much surprised by how acurately it descibes me - to some extent. There are some parts that I don't recognize, but in general it descibes me a lot better than the other four categories.</p>
			<p>According to Professor Anthony Gregorc, I "love the world of theory and abstract thought." Well. What a perfect fit - as a theoretical physicist (in being) I wouldn't want to put myself in a different perspective. For one part, however, I don't see myself as a physicist. That's when I think of my professors, they're people who thrive in the world of science, but when it comes to social endavours, things can get awkward.</p>
			<p>The way I look upon my thinking style is similar to how I regard myself as a physicist. The Abstract Sequential thinker is described as someone who likes analyzing and applying logic, but on the other hand they're also identified as people who don't do well when it comes to sentimental thinking, expressing emotions and being diplomatic</p>
			<p>Since I don't think this is a big issue for me, I will not write about this part anymore. Something else I recognize is that I learn best when I have access to experts and references. I might want to put that the other way around: I don't learn that well when I don't have experts around - especially when I'm stuck. The biggest, pretty much only struggle I've had was positioning with CSS. I ended up doing a lot of research, sort of as I got stuck in the phase of "analyzing situations before making decision", as described by Professor Gregorc. It is an act of perfectionism: I just can't let it go until I understand what I'm doing. That resulted in putting in a lot more effort compared to other weeks.</p>
			<p>The main part of this issue is that there isn't anyone around to ask. I think the barrier of putting it on our DBC community is just too big, I live in a different time-zone, which means I often have to wait many hours before having a respond. I think I will make good use of the posibilities to ask a question when I have one at DBC.</p>
			<p>As a Abstract Sequential, I think it is natural for me to have an open mind-set. I don't see a direct link between the two, but I think "physicist" is linked to it. One of the key elements in understanding the principles of nature is to question everything that you see, and to be open to all weirdness that nature has to offer, for example that of Quantum Mechanic or the consequences of Einsteins Relativity. And since there is a connection between a physicist and an Abstract Sequential, I think I think I can be regarded as someone with an open-mindset as well.</p>
