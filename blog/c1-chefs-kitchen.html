		<div class="blogtitle">The Vibe of Dev Bootcamp</div>
		<div>What were my expectations and how do I think they will comply? </div>

		<p>When I started my research about Dev Bootcamp, there were two things that caught my attention. Firstly, DBC is a relatively young company and secondly, participating in DBC will require hardcore discipline and effort. Both played a large role in my decision to sign up.</p>

<p>Since DBC is young, there wasn’t an enormous amount of reviews on which to base my decision. Unlike an acknowledged university, there is not much of a guarantee that the education will be good. That made it hard for me to convince my parents that it was a good idea to postpone the start of my Masters degree for a year. With the considerably high tuition, my father tried to push me towards MIT instead, since the fee there is about the same. Nevertheless, I didn't want to go to university, I wanted to pursue coding. </p>

<p>I never realized that exactly the young nature of DBC brings a unique experience that comes with a lot of advantages. From my classes at university, I'm used to being told exactly what to do. DBC instead offers more room for your own input, as it is still in an "experimental phase", as denoted in Shereef's Fireside Chat. I’m really looking forward to what extent this difference in learning environment will affect me. I'm not exactly sure what to expect.</p>

<p>What I also recall from my Physics classes is having to perform really hard. I'm used to studying 10 hours a day, and not just because it is the final week before one of my exams. DBCs environment will ask me for my discipline and I think I'm perfectly ready to give that.</p>

<p>During these days of 10 hours of study, my world usually was really egocentric: I was working all by myself trying not to get distracted by hanging out with people or to get slowed down because of working together with someone. DBC will require me to put that aside. I have noticed there is a great stress on pairing, and I'm really curious how that will work out for me. I think I can be an excellent teamplayer, but from what I have learnt from all previous pairing experiences, there are some strict conditions that need to be met.</p>

<p>I wrote a lot papers with other people, and often I have been greatly bother by my partners because I didn't feel I could trust them on the work they deliver. I ended up checking their work - well, that’s not bad, you should always check each others work to see how you're going to blend into your "master file" - but then it turned out to be really bad and I ended up rephrasing 80% of their work. This sort of experience has pushed me towards my preference of working alone.</p>

<p>However, I have also experienced the joy of working together. A few times, I've had a partner with whom I was perfectly on the same level. In this situation, productivity is greatly enhanced. Work is completed a lot faster, and ever better: you learn from helping out each other at the moment you get stuck. </p></div>
