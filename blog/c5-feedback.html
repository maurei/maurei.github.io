		<div>Two constant factors present during DBC</div>

What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?
Was something particularly fun or rewarding?
Was something frustrating and difficult for you?
			<p>It has been quite a ride for me to get used to pairing so much on the challenges. At first, there was this practical barrier to overcome of finding someone that will work with you at a suitable time. That proved to be a challenge each time because of my time difference with San Francisco. Occasionally, I had to get back on working on DBC for a pairing session at a moment I would have prefered to be finished for the rest of the day</p>
			<p>Nevertheless, this practical issue is easily compensated by the advantages of pairing. One thing I really like is that I already am in regular contact with my cohort mates, which probably wouldn't have been the case without the pairing sessions. Arriving at campus in DBC, I think it will be nice to know a few people in advance.</p>
