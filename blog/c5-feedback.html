		<div class="blogtitle">Pairing and Feedback</div>
		<div>Two constant factors present during DBC</div>

			<p>It has been quite a ride for me to get used to pairing so much on the challenges. At first, there was this practical barrier to overcome of finding someone that will work with you at a suitable time. That proved to be a challenge each time because of my time difference with San Francisco. Occasionally, I had to get back on working on DBC for a pairing session at a moment I would have prefered to be finished for the rest of the day</p>
			<p>Nevertheless, this practical issue is easily compensated by the advantages of pairing. One thing I really like is that I am in regular contact with my cohort mates now, something which probably wouldn't have been the case without the pairing sessions. Arriving at campus in DBC, I think it will be nice to know a few people in advance.</p>
			<p>I must admit that I found pairing harder than expected. At first, I was afraid of a language barrier. That is something I overcame pretty fast. I learned that I'm vulnerable to somesort of "panic" reaction. It sounds a little drastic - it isn't - but I'm not sure how to put it. I would say I have a firm grasp of most of the concepts, but it can always happen that the one I'm pairing with comes up with an idea that I don't instantly follow.</p>
			<p>In this situation, I noticed that I tend to only ask once to for another explanation, and when it's not fully clear, I tend to ignore that and try to move it. Then, that results in more and more confusion. I also found that just taking two minutes for myself to look at it during the session, or to just admit that I still don't get it, asking him or her to walk me through every step, easily solves issue.</p>
			<p>From the feedback, I have learnt that I should stick more to my role when driving. I tend to just start writing code, explaining to the navigator what I'm doing. In the mean while, I tend to navigate at the same time. After being told so, I did my best to stick to my role, and I feel there has been improvement.</p>
