		<div class="blogtitle">Stereotype Threat</div>
		<div>What is the Impostor Syndrome?</div>
		<div class="blogdate">December 2nd, 2014</div>
		<div class="blogdescription">
		<p>Raising awareness about a problem is often a good to make it disappear. Upon reading the phrase "Stereotype Threat", I immediately had a good clue about what it was, eventhough I have never read about it. Allow me to introduce you to the concept of stereotype threat, also known as the imposter syndrome, so that you will be able to tackle it whenever you encounter it.</p>
		<p>
		As defined by Steele & Aronson (1995), a stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group. A very familiar example is the alleged vulnerability of women when it comes to occupying important positions in large businesses, in which women tend to think they're not worth a job because of their gender.</p>
		<p>
		I find this example particulary striking. It seems to be a part an overarching stereotypical threat problem of failed women emancipation. In the beginning of the previous century, it wasn't evident that a women could and would start an academic career. For the largest part, emancipation in this field has succeeded, but there still is a visible legacy.</p>
		<p>
		I have spent some time on the University of Amsterdam, the faculty of Science in particular. During my studies of Physics, it is common to have a class existing out of just 10%-20% of females. A common stereotype - I believe - is that males are in general better at mathematics and other technical subjects. Eventhough I have never heard anyone say anything like this in my direct surroundings, the gender ratio among both students and teachers confirm the stereotype.</p>
		<p>
		I feel like I shouldn't even have to mention it, but of course, there is no reason to believe males prevail at performing science. There have been (many) female class-mates I have relied on when solving certain exercises. For me, there is no reason to believe the validity of this stereotype threat.</p>
		<p>
		While writing code isn't exactly the same as peforming math, they are both technical by nature and I expect the environment of Dev Bootcamp to be similar to the evironment of my Physics classes. Althought the gender ratio is the legacy of an old problem that could be classified as a stereotype threat, I have never observed a female class-mate suffering from any symptons. Therefore, I expect the same to happen at Dev Bootcamp.
