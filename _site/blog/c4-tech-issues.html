		<p>From the moment that Edward Snowden left the USA with his suitcase stuffed with classified documents, we started to realize our privacy is at great danger. It became more and more clear that practically everything we do on the internet is tracable. It started with worrying reports of unnecessary logs of innocent people's phonerecords, but even outrageous reports followed of for example NSA employees spying on their wifes for suspecting them of cheating. Political relations with European countries became seriously damaged when it leaked that the US government had been spying on European officials.</p>

		<p>Governments can monitor pretty much everything what we do in the digital world. It has accomplished so by many ways, for example spreading a complex virus which has infected a large part of the worlds computers without anyone knowning about it, but also by using backdoors in software used by telecom providers or cloud services like DropBox.</p>

		<p>As a result, people are becoming increasingly interested in how to prevent anyone from watching us on the internet. New services started to pop-up. One particular example is Telegram, a "safe" alternative to WhatsApp, which is Europes most populair instant messaging application for mobile devices.</p>

		<p>One thing most "safe" applications have in common, is that they're open source. The big advantage of software being open-source, is that anyone can look into the source-code. That seems pretty trivial, but let me explain what point I'm trying to make. If all important software we use would be open-source, anyone would be able to detect insecurities, even <i>before</i> the government finds it and designs a large scale spying system to abuse it. Also, companies wouldn't be able to include (voluntairy or forced by officials) a backdoor in their databases because eveyone could find out.</p>

		<p>Open-sourcing everything on the web probably isn't as easy as I put it in this blog, but the principle shows a solution to any evil power trying to spy on us.</p>
