			When you're in trouble with something you don't understand, you can either keep on trying to figure it out by yourself, risking to go down a rabbit hole. Or you can get help by asking a question. When asking a question, it is important to do your best at making it a good one. Bad questions result in bad answers and ultimately, it will negatively affect your understanding of what your question was about. So, what are things to keep in mind when formulating a question?
		</p>
		<p>
			Firstly, make sure you have thoroughly searched for answer. Doing your research and being able to explain what you have seen and why it didn't meet your needs, helps the person answering your question to be as specific as you need him to be.
		</p>
		<p>
			Secondly, be specific. Posing a vague question will probably lead you to a vague answer. The more details you provide with your questions, the more relevant the answer will be.
		</p>
		<p>
			Lastly, be aware of the fact that there might not be an answer that you're looking for. Keep an open mind, because a conclusive answer isn't always possible. When you are unsure about someones solution, ask for their source or push for more clarification.
